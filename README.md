# At-War
Faction change from Scyer to Alder in 2.5.0 when 2.5.1 occurred I became at war with both Alder and Scyer.
Charcter is an 80 Blood Elf Shadow Priest, had switched faction and am at 3570/6000 (friendly) with the Aldor ( can not progress further).
Had done all the Aldor quests in Shattrath and was turning in Armaments and Marks there, but when the update occurred 
Adyen The Lightwarden and Ishanah would no longer talk to me or take them.  All the Aldor NPCs are green to me but
will not talk to me.

I have also completed the Aldor quest line in Netherstorm through Attack on Manaforge Coruu, Shutting Down Manaforge Duro and Sunfury Briefings, however Anchorite Karja and Exarch Orelis would no longer talk to me so that I can turn in these finished quests and proceed.

I have checked my reputation list and both Aldor and Scyer have checks in the "at war" box, but both are greyed out so I can not remove the "at war".

I am now using 2.5.5 update but this is still the same way.  How can the "at war" be removed so that I may continue
